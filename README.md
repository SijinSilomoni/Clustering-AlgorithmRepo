# Clustering-AlgorithmRepo
Clustering Algorithm Project Summary:-
This project focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques to the Iris dataset using clustering algorithms. The objective is to demonstrate an understanding of clustering methods, their implementation, and visualization to uncover patterns in the data without relying on predefined labels.

Steps Involved:
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The Iris dataset from the sklearn library is used.
The species column is dropped since clustering does not use labels.
Clustering Algorithms
Two clustering techniques are implemented and evaluated:

A. KMeans Clustering
Groups data into a fixed number of clusters by minimizing variance within clusters.
Suitable for the Iris dataset due to its continuous numeric features and relatively small size.
Implementation involves clustering the data and visualizing the results.

B. Hierarchical Clustering
Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) of clusters based on similarity metrics.
Ideal for small datasets like Iris, providing insights into cluster hierarchy.
Implementation involves forming clusters and visualizing them with a dendrogram and scatter plots.
Visualization

For both algorithms, clusters are visualized using scatter plots, and the hierarchical method includes a dendrogram for better interpretability.

Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with unsupervised learning methods.
Practical application of clustering algorithms to real-world data.
Understanding how to preprocess data and visualize clustering results.
